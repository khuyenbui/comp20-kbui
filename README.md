Web Programming - COMP 20 - Spring 15
By Khuyen Bui.

This repository contains my work for the Web Programming class with 4 assignments. 

My favorite assignment was building the server for the Marauder's map (assignment 3). I realized I enjoyed doing the back-end; I missed the intensive coding experience from Comp 40 - Machine Structure and Assembly Language. It was nice to build functions that does only one thing, test and debug them.

I've grown a lot from Day 1 especially about understanding the basic architecture of the web (request + response) and the front-end web development. Two most important things I learned in this course are
 1) **Event-driven/asynchronous programming**
  - I've had some experience with first class function (too many parentheses), but programming in JS poses a different challenges: I cannot structure my code step-by-step anymore. For example, in getting my own geolocation for the client side of Marauder's map (assignment 2) and submitting it to the server, I just have to write two callback functions success() and parseData() independent of each other.
 2) **Security**
  - I learned that security is beyond bad data (and there are so many ways to define "bad"). It is also about seeing the application as whole, what it does, who uses it and what is considered as harm.
 3) **Don't reinvent the wheel**
  - For the final project, Free Food at Tufts, we used different frameworks (Bootstrap for front end), fullcalendarjs for calendar, chrono-node for parsing date from string. I can probably write the parsing date from scratch, but it's not worth the time. Using a well-debugged libraries is way easier.

I would like to delve deeper in web engineering and interface design after this course. We barely scratched the surface of the world of web development, and presentation is more than half the battle ;)
